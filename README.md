Challenges Faced

‚ö†Ô∏è Callback Hell in Node.js

Managing nested callbacks in Node.js, leading to an unreadable and difficult-to-debug codebase.

Solution: Implemented async/await and Promises to avoid callback hell and ensure better maintainability.

‚ö†Ô∏è Handling High Traffic Loads

Scaling the backend to handle a high number of concurrent users and API requests.

Solution: Used load balancers, caching (Redis), and optimized database queries with indexing.

‚ö†Ô∏è UI Rendering Delays

Ensuring smooth UI performance when dealing with large datasets and complex visualizations.

Solution: Implemented lazy loading, pagination, and virtual DOM optimizations for better frontend performance.

‚ö†Ô∏è Data Consistency and Accuracy

Ensuring accurate ML predictions with ever-changing datasets.

Solution: Implemented regular model retraining with real-time data pipelines.
